# fazip

fazip is a simple utilty for zipping and unzipping files with your face.

## How it works

- Save the recognized faces' encoding in a MySQL database.
- Set a master password for fazip to zip/unzip all the files with.
- Whenever you want to unzip a file, instead of writing the password, fazip will look for you face and, if authorized, it will unpack the file.
